                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

                    <p>I supported a GOV.UK organisation in modernising migration through two distinct workstreams.</p>

                    <h3>Workstreams</h3>

                    <p>One workstream seeks to enhance the current digital immigration status service for millions of
                        global users, and another workstream explores biometric self-enrolment for seamless,
                        passport-less identity
                        verification in the future.</p>

                    <h3>In a nutshell</h3>

                    <p>Our user-centred design (UCD) approach combined Figma mobile prototypes with a Heroku-hosted
                        GOV.UK service, enabling usability testing across diverse demographics, including varying
                        digital literacy levels, age groups, and nationalities.</p>

                    <p>Notably for workstream one, we achieved a first-time GDS assessment pass, advancing the
                        service to public Beta to support 5+ million users worldwide.</p>
                </section>

                </section>

                <section id="problem">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

                    <h3>Workstream 1: Digital immigration status service</h3>

                    <p>For one workstream, users needed a seamless way to prove their immigration status digitally,
                        replacing traditional
                        physical documents. However, key challenges included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users with limited digital skills struggled with verification</li>
                        <li>Inaccessible content due to complex terminology and acronyms</li>
                        <li>Technology failures leaving users unable to prove their status</li>
                        <li>Users without identity documents facing barriers to account setup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, the service needed to respond rapidly to policy shifts, such as physical documents
                        expiring
                        in 2024, while ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.</p>

                    <h3>Workstream 2: Biometric self-enrolment trials</h3>

                    <p>For the second workstream, the challenges were:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Addressing user trust and security concerns related to biometric data collection and
                            storage</li>
                        <li>Integrating secure biometric authentication processes within wider account creation and
                            management user journeys</li>
                    </ul>

                <section id="solution">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <div class="divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>
                    <p>Our approach combined rapid prototyping, usability testing, and policy stakeholder collaboration.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Workstream 1: Digital immigration status service</h3>

                    <p>For the first workstream involving the immigration status service, I did the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>developed a hybrid approach integrating a Figma mobile prototyping with a GOV.UK coded
                            prototype in HTML, CSS, JavaScript to simulate an omni-channel experience</li>
                        <li>tested the service with diverse users across multiple countries, ensuring accessibility for
                            different age groups, digital literacy levels, and technical constraints</li>
                        <li>streamlined content and simplified complex terminology to improve comprehension,
                            particularly for users with limited English skills
                        </li>

                        <!-- <li>Introduced alternative verification routes, allowing users without identity documents to
                        register through a ‘No ID’ account journey.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented assisted digital support through partnerships with community organisations and
                        live webchat services for users needing extra help.
                    </li> -->
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Workstream 2: Biometric self-enrolment trials</h3>

                    <p>For the second workstream involving biometric self-enrolment trials, I did the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>designed and coded custom UI components for fingerprint and facial recognition, enhancing
                            the identity verification process with user-centric design
                            principles</li>
                        <li>iterated the prototype based on design crit feedback and user testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Inclusive design practices were used throughout, giving different options for people who do not
                        have all fingers or cannot scan their face (e.g. for religious reasons).</p>

                            and improve digital service accessibility.</li>
                        <li>Prototyping: Developed iterative prototypes in Figma, refining workflows based on continuous
                            feedback from stakeholders and users.</li>
                        <li>Accessibility compliance: Ensured compliance with WCAG standards and best practices for
                            digital inclusion.</li>
                        <li>Collaboration: Worked closely with policy makers, product managers, and development teams to
                            align design solutions with business goals.</li>

                    <h3>Workstream 2: Biometric self-enrolment trials</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>User research: Engaged participants in biometric trials to understand attitudes towards
                            fingerprint and facial recognition for identity verification.</li>
                        <li>Prototyping: Created custom UI components for biometric enrolment, iterating based on
                            real-world testing results.</li>
                        <li>Security & trust: Focused on user trust through transparent communication about biometric

                            and service designers to ensure robust, future-ready solutions.</li>

                    <p>By adopting a user-centred, omni-channel design approach, we successfully improved the digital
                        immigration status service, ensuring it works for all users, regardless of digital ability or
                        access to technology.</p>
                    <p>My hybrid Figma and GOV.UK prototyping method allowed rapid iteration, enabling the team to
                        respond
                        swiftly to policy shifts and real-world challenges.</p>
                    <p>Through dedicated efforts on both digital identity management and biometric enrolment trials, we
                        have significantly advanced migration service design.</p>

                    <p>This work highlights the balance between
                        security, usability, and accessibility, setting new benchmarks in digital public
                        service transformation.</p>
